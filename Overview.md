## 1. Kubernetes ecosystem

On this topic, we will describe what the Kubernetes is. How it works and from which components consist is.

## 2. Deploy Kubernetes on Google Cloud (GKE)

This is an initial step. We will deploy the Kubernetes cluster manually and will see how it works on GKE example.

## 3. Blue-Green Deployment, Rolling Update, Canary Deployment

We will try the most popular methods for deployments in Kubernetes.

## 4. Storages, Stateful services.

Working with storages and stateful sets is the most frequent case in working with Kubernetes. We will describe these topics.

## 5. Update StatefulSets application. DaemonSets.

Hands-on step: we will deploy StatefullSet application.

## 6. Scaling: Scaling nodes, Scaling pods (manually, auto-scaling by CPU and custom metrics)

We will describe how to scale our applications in a few ways with a practice in our Kubernetes cluster.

## 7. Secrets and ConfigMaps

This is step will explain how to manage secrets and ConfigMaps in Kubernetes.

## 8. Ingress controllers

We will describe when we need Ingress and how to use in our Kubernetes cluster.

## 9. Advances scheduling

Tips and tricks in Kubernetes: Advanced scheduling and which benefits we will get to work with it.

## 10. Java Specific cases

The Java application can be complicated in usage in Docker container and you need some additional knowledge use it right. Let’s talk about it.

## 11. Practical case with Java App in GKE

Hands-on step: Let’s try to work with Java in our Kubernetes cluster.
