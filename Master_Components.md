## Kubernetes master components

master component | Description
--- | ---
kube-apiserver | __cloud.ibm.com__ The Kubernetes API server serves as the main entry point for all cluster management requests from the worker node to the Kubernetes master. The Kubernetes API server validates and processes requests that change the state of Kubernetes resources, such as pods or services, and stores this state in etcd.
  | __kubernetes.io__ The Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, replicationcontrollers, and others. The API Server services REST operations and provides the frontend to the cluster’s shared state through which all other components interact.
